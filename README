issues to fix : 
- vibrations --> detect if available & check if it works built for phones
- sound : some issues with sound occasionnaly (due to using html5 audio)
to add/improve:
- settings (change volume level, why cardiac coherence)
- more options sound (youtube/spotify import?) / more options gong 
- improve app's esthetic
- try to improve app's performance/code
- work on user's experience (animations, minimalist design)
more advanced:
